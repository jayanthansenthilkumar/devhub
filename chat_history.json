Lissencephaly:**\n\n* Rare brain malformation characterized by a smooth brain surface due to impaired neuronal migration.\n* Mutations in the DCX gene can cause lissencephaly.\n\n**2. Subcortical Band Heterotopia:**\n\n* Abnormality in neuronal migration where neurons fail to reach the cerebral cortex and form bands below.\n* DCX mutations are associated with a subset of cases.\n\n**3. Epilepsy:**\n\n* Seizures can occur in individuals with DCX mutations due to abnormal neuronal connectivity and electrical activity.\n\n**4. Psychiatric Disorders:**\n\n* Reduced DCX expression has been implicated in psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder.\n\n**Diagnostics:**\n\n* Genetic testing for DCX mutations can help diagnose genetic causes of lissencephaly and subcortical band heterotopia.\n* Immunohistochemistry can detect DCX expression in brain tissue samples.\n\n**Treatment:**\n\n* There is no specific treatment for DCX-related disorders.\n* Supportive care and therapies can address associated symptoms, such as seizures and developmental delays.\n* Research is ongoing to develop potential therapies targeting DCX function."}]
